defmodule Managoat.Docs.Markdown do
  @moduledoc """
  Markdown → HTML, rendered through [MDEx](https://hexdocs.pm/mdex) (comrak),
  on two paths that share one pipeline: `to_html/1` for untrusted input
  (agent or user output) and `to_trusted_html/1` for an authored manual. Both
  return a binary of HTML; a Phoenix caller wraps it in `Phoenix.HTML.raw/1`.
  The untrusted path closes two holes that a plain markdown-to-HTML call
  leaves open (Fountain #323):

  1. Raw HTML — an agent emitting `<img src=x onerror=...>` as its own
     paragraph must not become live markup.
  2. Markdown link/image syntax accepts any URL scheme —
     `[x](javascript:...)` must not render as a live link.

  `to_html/1` walks the parsed document before rendering: every raw-HTML node
  (block and inline) is replaced by a text node carrying its source, so the
  renderer escapes it and the HTML displays as text rather than executing.
  Links and images are dropped unless their URL scheme is on the allowlist —
  http/https/mailto for links, http/https for images, relative URLs for both
  — and a dropped link or image is unwrapped to its text/alt so the content
  still reads. The untrusted path additionally renders with comrak's
  `unsafe: false` + `escape: true`, so even a raw-HTML node the walk missed
  would be escaped rather than emitted.

  Scheme checks run on a normalized copy of the URL: character references
  decoded and the whitespace/control characters browsers ignore stripped, so
  `java&#115;cript:` or `java\\tscript:` cannot smuggle a scheme past the
  check. Normalization is deliberately generous — over-decoding can only
  make the filter stricter.

  # caches its list into `deps/lumis/priv/lumis` before `mix release`, which
  # copies it in like any other dependency's priv. Nothing is fetched at
  # runtime. This is the default list; a host names its own with
  # `use Managoat.Docs, languages: [...]`, and `Managoat.Docs.GuardrailCase`
  # fails if its manual grows a fence in a language the list does not name.
